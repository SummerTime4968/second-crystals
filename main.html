        <h1 style="font-family:helvetica"> I'M CONFUSED AS HELL!</h1>

        <p style="font-family:helvetica"> Okay, this is pretty confusing for me so I'll just tell you what I could comprehend. On Sunday, 
        February 4th at 1:46 PM. Li, a member of the server did not want Cran to get Laff started. Then at  1:50 PM, Cran started speaking
        German and then tried to marry the Marriage bot. At 1:57 PM, Bat gug stated that them and Mocha are "already kinda" divorced, which
        gave Li and Cran quite the laughter before Cran announces that they will marry Mocha's kid. Mocha's kid which is Li happily accepts
        the request to get married. At 2:16 PM, Li threatned to give Cran mouth herpes. At 2:19 PM, multiple things happened. Li forgot to tell
        her mom that their cat had shat on the floor, Laff announced that they liked "A MELANIE MArteniz SO D 😭😭", Laff adds on that it was
        because of Rainworld. Bat gug shares a embed image of a roblox avatar saying "itsa because i look like a horse isnt it", then Li points
        out the tramutized face on the roblox avatar, which bat replied "I DONT KNOW".</p>
