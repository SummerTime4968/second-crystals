        <h1 style="font-family:helvetica"> I'M CONFUSED AS HELL!</h1>

        <p style="font-family:helvetica"> Okay, this is pretty confusing for me so I'll just tell you what I could comprehend. On Sunday, 
        February 4th at 1:46 PM. Li, a member of the server did not want Cran to get Laff started. Then at  1:50 PM, Cran started speaking
        German and then tried to marry the Marriage bot. At 1:57 PM, Bat gug stated that them and Mocha are "already kinda" divorced, which
        gave Li and Cran quite the laughter before Cran announces that they will marry Mocha's kid. Mocha's kid which is Li happily accepts
        the request to get married. At 2:16 PM, Li threatned to give Cran mouth herpes. At 2:19 PM, multiple things happened. Li forgot to tell
        her mom that their cat had shat on the floor, Laff announced that they liked "A MELANIE MArteniz SO D ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­", Laff adds on that it was
        because of Rainworld. Bat gug shares a embed image of a roblox avatar saying "itsa because i look like a horse isnt it", then Li points
        out the tramutized face on the roblox avatar, which bat replied "I DONT KNOW".</p>

        <p style="font-family:helvetica"> At 2:22 PM, Cran asked bat if they would divorce Mocha but is then interrupted by Li questioning them
        if they are a communist, and then the phrase "pepsi drinker". At 2:24 PM, Cran sends an embed video of their dog, but Li points out a
        figure in the video in which Cran responds saying that the figure was their mom, which Li had a laugh. At 2:26 PM, Cran asks bat again if
        they would divorce Mocha, but is then interrupted by Li again by saying "tell her I said I'm sorry for fucking ur dad", which Cran is disgusted
        by. Bat then goes online with Cran welcoming bat with the phrase "HI MY PARENT IN LAW", which bat replies with "whatd i do", which after
        did Laff start laughing like Freddy Fazbear. Then Cran forces bat to answer their question in which Bat answers with "idk". It is then
        revealed that Bat is in a game right now in which Cran states that "bat im joining you rn cunt" and then "IM PRO HACKER".</p>
