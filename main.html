        <h1>Laff messages Russian user, gets sent F-slur!</h1>

        <p>Laff learned the hard way that not everyone is friendly 
        on the internet, after she forgot that she messaged a Russian user 
        on Discord a long time ago.</p>

        <p>Laff, said she was bored and curious one night, and decided 
        to message some discord users. She said that she messaged a 
        Russian user that drew Hitler a long time ago. She said that 
        she had apparently forgot about the message and didn't expect 
        anything. but instead, she got a response. The message 
        from the russian read "What" and "Who are you" and then
        the russian sent the F-slur to her. She replied with "please 
        stop 🤯"</p>
            
        <p>Later, Laff was shocked to see that the russian user had responded
        back as they never even realized they answered her back until she realized.
        She tried to apologize to the russian user as she was afraid that they'll 
        probably cuss her out. She states "I DIDNT KNOW BRO WOULD RESPOND BECAUSE I SAID
        IT IN ENGLISH BUT HE DID. AND HE DIDNT LIKE WHAT I SAID APPARENTLY."</p>

        <p>Safe to say, unless you <b>really know</b> what you're doing. Always be careful
        whenever you randomly message someone on discord.</p>
